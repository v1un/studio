## AI Game Master Automation

### **Intelligent Decision Making**

The AI GM continuously analyzes game state and makes autonomous decisions:

```typescript
interface GMAnalysis {
  storyMomentum: number;      // 0-1 scale of narrative pacing
  playerEngagement: number;   // 0-1 scale of interaction quality
  narrativeConsistency: number; // 0-1 scale of story coherence
  systemBalance: number;      // 0-1 scale of game balance
}
```

### **Automatic Interventions**

Based on analysis, the AI GM automatically:

- **Auto-levels characters** when they have sufficient experience
- **Provides emergency healing** when health is critically low
- **Suggests equipment upgrades** for under-equipped characters
- **Balances difficulty** by adjusting enemy strength
- **Maintains narrative flow** by triggering appropriate events
- **Creates new quests** when player engagement is low
- **Manages relationships** during positive story moments
- **Controls environmental factors** to match story atmosphere

### **Decision Priority System**

GM decisions are prioritized as:
1. **Critical**: Life-threatening situations, game-breaking issues
2. **High**: Significant balance problems, story inconsistencies
3. **Medium**: Character progression, equipment suggestions
4. **Low**: Minor optimizations, atmospheric adjustments

## Command Examples

### **Player Commands**
```
"I want to level up and learn a new fire spell"
→ ✓ Character leveled up! Now level 5.

```

### **AI GM Automation**
