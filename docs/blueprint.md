- Accent color: Teal (#009688) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Literata', serif, for headlines
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for body text
- Simple, clear icons for story controls (undo, restart) and menu options.
- Subtle fade-in animations for each new scene to create a smooth reading experience.
