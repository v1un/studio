## Technical Implementation

### Core Files
- `src/lib/progression-engine.ts` - Core progression logic and calculations
- `src/lib/skill-trees.ts` - Skill tree definitions and data
- `src/types/story.ts` - Type definitions for progression system

### UI Components
- `src/components/progression/level-up-modal.tsx` - Level up interface
- `src/components/progression/skill-tree-viewer.tsx` - Skill tree visualization
- `src/components/progression/progression-manager.tsx` - Main progression interface

### Integration Points
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main game integration and event handling
- `src/components/story-forge/character-sheet.tsx` - Character display updates

## Usage Examples

### Level Up Process
1. Player gains enough XP to level up
2. System automatically processes level up and awards progression points
3. Level up modal appears with attribute allocation interface
4. Player allocates attribute points and sees stat preview
5. Player confirms allocation and modal closes
6. Character sheet updates with new stats and available points

### Skill Tree Progression
1. Player opens Progression tab
2. Selects desired skill tree (Combat, Magic, etc.)
3. Views available skills and prerequisites
