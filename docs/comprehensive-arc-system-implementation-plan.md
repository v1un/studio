## Integration Points with Existing Systems

### Combat System Integration
```typescript
// Example integration in combat resolution
const combatResult = processCombatAction(combatState, action);
const arcIntegration = arcManager.updateArc(
  currentArcId, 
  character, 
  storyState, 
  turnId, 
  'combat_result', 
  { combatState, result: combatResult }
);
```

### Quest System Integration
```typescript
// Example integration in quest progression
const questUpdate = updateQuestProgress(quest, choice);
const arcIntegration = arcManager.updateArc(
  currentArcId,
  character,
  storyState,
  turnId,
  'quest_event',
  { quest, event: questUpdate }
);
```

### Progression System Integration
```typescript
// Example integration in level up
const levelUpResult = processLevelUp(character);
const arcIntegration = arcManager.updateArc(
  currentArcId,
  character,
  storyState,
  turnId,
  'progression_event',
  levelUpResult
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Arc
```typescript
const arcInput: ArcGenerationInput = {
  seriesName: "Re:Zero",
  seriesContext: "Current story context...",
  character: currentCharacter,
  storyState: currentStoryState,
  previousArcs: completedArcs,
  playerPreferences: {
    preferredThemes: ['growth', 'relationships'],
    preferredDifficulty: 6,
    preferredPacing: 'moderate',
    // ... other preferences
  },
  worldState: {
    currentLocation: "Roswaal Manor",
    threatLevel: 4,
    // ... other world state
  },
  narrativeGoals: {
    primaryGoal: "Character development",
    // ... other goals
  }
};

const result = await arcManager.createNewArc(arcInput);
```

### Updating Arc on Player Choice
```typescript
const choiceData = {
  turnId: currentTurnId,
  choiceText: "Help the villagers",
  choiceDescription: "Decide to assist the village with their problem",
  alternatives: ["Ignore the problem", "Seek more information"],
  consequences: [/* consequence objects */],
  impactScope: 'arc',
  moralAlignment: 'good',
  agencyScore: 8,
  narrativeWeight: 7
};

const updateResult = arcManager.updateArc(
  currentArcId,
  character,
  storyState,
  turnId,
  'player_choice',
  choiceData
);
```

### Monitoring Arc Health
```typescript
const analytics = arcManager.getArcAnalytics(currentArcId);
console.log(`Arc Quality Score: ${analytics.qualityScore}`);
console.log(`Player Satisfaction: ${analytics.playerSatisfactionEstimate}`);
console.log(`Agency Score: ${analytics.playerAgencyMetrics.overallAgencyScore}`);
```
