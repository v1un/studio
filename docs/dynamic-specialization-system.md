# Dynamic Specialization Generation System

## Overview

The Dynamic Specialization Generation System enhances the existing hard-coded specialization trees with AI-powered, context-aware specialization generation. This system creates personalized specialization trees based on character development, story progression, and series-specific themes while maintaining the reliability of the base hard-coded content.

## Core Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Hybrid Approach**
- **Preserves existing hard-coded trees** as reliable base content and fallback options
- **Adds AI-generated specializations** that adapt to story context and character development
- **Seamless integration** without breaking existing functionality

### ðŸ§  **AI-Powered Generation**
- **Story-contextual specializations** based on recent events and narrative progression
- **Character-driven trees** reflecting personality, class, and past choices
- **Series-specific adaptation** matching anime/light novel themes and power systems
- **Hybrid tree creation** combining templates with dynamic content

### âš¡ **Dynamic Triggers**
- **Scenario generation** - Initial specializations during character creation
- **Level milestones** - New trees every 5 levels
- **Story events** - Specializations triggered by significant narrative moments
- **Arc transitions** - New paths when entering different story phases

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`src/lib/specialization-engine.ts`** - Enhanced with dynamic generation functions
2. **`src/ai/flows/dynamic-specialization-generation.ts`** - AI generation flows
3. **`src/app/api/specializations/trees/route.ts`** - Updated API endpoints
4. **`src/components/specializations/specialization-manager.tsx`** - Enhanced UI component

### Key Functions

#### Dynamic Generation
```typescript
generateDynamicSpecializations(context, settings)
```
- Analyzes character and story context
- Generates new specialization trees
- Validates and balances content
- Provides fallback to hard-coded trees

#### Context Analysis
```typescript
analyzeSpecializationContext(context)
```
- Extracts character themes from class, personality, and skills
- Analyzes story themes from recent events
- Determines power level and preferred categories
- Gets series-specific context and restrictions

#### Hybrid Tree Creation
```typescript
generateHybridSpecializationTree(context, category, existingTrees, analysis)
```
- Combines existing templates with dynamic content
- Creates contextual variations of base trees
- Maintains balance and series authenticity

## Generation Context

### Character Analysis
- **Class-based themes** (warrior â†’ martial prowess, mage â†’ arcane knowledge)
- **Personality traits** (brave â†’ heroic resolve, intelligent â†’ tactical thinking)
- **Skill patterns** (sword skills â†’ blade mastery, healing â†’ supportive nature)
- **Attribute strengths** (high charisma â†’ social influence)

### Story Analysis
- **Recent events** (battles â†’ warfare themes, diplomacy â†’ political intrigue)
- **Current story arc** (revenge â†’ vengeance seeking, redemption â†’ moral growth)
- **Relationship dynamics** (mentors â†’ skill guidance, rivals â†’ competitive growth)
- **Narrative threads** (mysteries â†’ knowledge pursuit, survival â†’ endurance mastery)

### Series Context
- **Re:Zero**: Spirit magic, time loops, psychological trauma, political intrigue
- **Attack on Titan**: Military tactics, survival horror, technological warfare
- **My Hero Academia**: Heroic ideals, quirk development, social responsibility
- **Generic Fantasy**: Adventure themes, magic discovery, heroic journey

## Quality Assurance

### Balance Validation
- **Point cost limits** (1-3 points per node)
- **Bonus value caps** (maximum 50% bonuses)
- **Tree size limits** (4-8 nodes based on balance level)
- **Power level scaling** appropriate to character progression

### Series Compliance
- **Canonical restrictions** enforced per series
- **Thematic consistency** with source material
- **Power system alignment** with established rules
- **Narrative authenticity** maintained

### Fallback Systems
- **Hard-coded tree fallback** if generation fails
- **Template-based recovery** for partial failures
- **Conservative defaults** for unknown series
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation

## Integration Points

### Scenario Generation
```typescript
// In character skills phase
const specializationCharacter = initializeSpecializationProgression(
  enhancedCharacter, 
  generationData.seriesName
);
```

### Level Progression
```typescript
// Every 5 levels
if (newLevel % 5 === 0 && storyState && seriesName) {
  triggerDynamicSpecializationGeneration(character, storyState, seriesName, newLevel);
}
```

### UI Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced API calls with story context
const treesResult = await getAvailableSpecializationTrees(
  character, 
  storyState, 
  seriesName
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Dynamic Generation
```typescript
const context = {
  character: playerCharacter,
  storyState: currentStoryState,
  seriesName: 'Re:Zero',
  recentEvents: ['defeated powerful enemy', 'learned new magic'],
  generationTrigger: 'level_milestone'
};

const dynamicTrees = await generateDynamicSpecializations(context);
```

### Hybrid Tree Creation
```typescript
const settings = {
  maxTreesToGenerate: 2,
  preferredCategories: ['combat', 'magic'],
  hybridMode: true, // Combine with existing templates
  balanceLevel: 'moderate'
};
```

### Series-Specific Generation
```typescript
// Automatically adapts to series context
const reZeroTrees = await generateDynamicSpecializations({
  ...context,
  seriesName: 'Re:Zero'
}); // Will include time loop mechanics, spirit magic themes
```

## Benefits

### For Players
- **Personalized progression** that reflects their unique story journey
- **Meaningful choices** based on character development
- **Series authenticity** with canonical power systems
- **Reliable base content** always available as fallback

### For Developers
- **Extensible system** that grows with story content
- **Balanced progression** with built-in validation
- **Maintainable code** with clear separation of concerns
- **Robust error handling** with graceful degradation

### For Stories
- **Narrative integration** where abilities feel earned through experience
- **Dynamic adaptation** to different story directions
- **Series flexibility** supporting multiple anime/light novel settings
- **Contextual relevance** matching current story themes

## Future Enhancements

- **Player preference learning** to adapt generation to play style
- **Cross-character synergies** for party-based specializations
- **Temporal mechanics** for time-sensitive abilities
- **Community sharing** of generated specialization trees
- **Advanced AI models** for even more sophisticated generation

The Dynamic Specialization Generation System represents a significant advancement in character progression, providing the perfect balance between reliable base content and innovative, personalized character development that adapts to each player's unique story journey.
